      test the default case rule<br>
      check order of arguments for prim ops<br>
      add an autoTrim True/False mode<br>

    <b>Idea:</b> In the let rule, instead of having a trimmer for each binding, 
 use a joint trimmer and save a single copy of the environment for all bindings 
 in that let. Guess how much extra environment space the bindings will need, 
 and reserve that much space at the top of the environment. Can probably work
 out the maximum amount of stack space a given block of code will need. Test
 to make sure you have enough space for each block on entry to that block.<br>

  rules are executed.<br>
