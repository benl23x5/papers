<h1>Conversion from source language to Mark-3 code</h1>
  
<h2>Lexing<br>
   </h2>
   The first step in the conversion is lexical analysis. Ample uses a hand
 coded lexer which converts the program source, a string, into tokens.   
<pre>data Token<br>        = TokenError    String          -- used for reporing lex errors<br>        | TokenVarS	String		-- variables as strings<br>        | TokenVarI	Int             -- variables as indicies<br>        | TokenType	String          -- types<br>        | TokenCChar	Char            -- constants: Char, Int, Float, String, ...<br>        ...<br>	| TokenKCase                    -- keywords:  case, if, else, ...<br>        ...<br>        | TokenSAnd                     -- symbols:   &amp;, &amp;&amp;, !, !!, {, }, ...<br>        | TokenSNewLine<br><br>lexer :: String -&gt; [Token]</pre>
   In the lexer, newline characters are converted to <tt>TokenSNewLine</tt> 
 and variables are converted to <tt>(TokenVarS String)</tt>. A follow on &nbsp;function,
 <tt>stripTable</tt>, reads through the list of tokens and builds a table
of variable names and what line they occured on. Occurances of <tt>TokenSNewLine</tt>
 are then removed from the token stream and occurences of <tt>(TokenVarS
String)</tt>  are replaced by <tt>(TokenVarI Int)</tt> where the <tt>Int</tt>
is the offset  into the table for that variable.   
<pre>striptable :: [Token] -&gt; ([(String, Int)], [Token])</pre>
   This table is used help with error reporting. When an error is encountered, 
 at either compile-time or run-time, the nearest variable is looked up in 
the table and the corresponding source line number communicated to the user. 
  
<h2>Parsing</h2>
   Ample uses Happy to generate a parser for the source language. Happy takes 
 a set of rules and generates a function that converts a list of tokens to 
 a parse tree. Ample uses a data type called Exp to represent the parse tree. 
 The source for this datatype is shown in figure 1.<br>
  <br>
 <br>
   The Exp data type is a direct representation of the program source, apart 
 from a few de-sugaring conversions which are done on the fly in the Happy 
 rule set. These conversions are listed in figure 2.<br>

<h2>Conversion</h2>
   Once the program has been parsed, it is converted into a form suitable 
for  execution by Sestofts Mark-3 machine. A second, seperate data type, shown
 in figure 3, is used to represent the program in Mark-3 form. This type
is  also called Exp, though is located in a separate Haskell module.<br>
   <br>
   Conversion of the source parse tree to Mark-3 code involves four steps,
 Flattening, Normalisation, introduction of de Bruijn&nbsp; indicies and
building  of trimmers. The first three steps are related and are preformed
by the function  <tt>convertExp</tt>. The building of trimmers is performed
by the function  <tt>buildTrimmers</tt>.   
<pre>convertExp    :: VarTable -&gt; S.Exp -&gt; (Prog, Int)</pre>
     
<pre>buildTrimmers :: Prog -&gt;     Eix -&gt;   Prog</pre>
     
<h3><br>
   </h3>
     
<h3>Flattening</h3>
   Flattening is the process of taking a parse tree and inserting its nodes 
 into a heap. Heap pointers are used to represent the edges of the parse tree.<br>
   <br>
   This is a superficial process. In a sense it serves to undo the expressive 
 power of the implementation language in order to recover a lower level representation 
 of the parse tree. In many functional languages, an exprssion represented 
 by the data type shown in figure 1 would <i>already</i> by represented as 
 a collection of cells in <i>the</i> heap. However, this representation would 
 not normally be visible to the implementation programming model.<br>
   <br>
   The Ample implementation calls a heap cell that represents a node in the 
 parse tree a 'program cell', and its pointer an 'expression index' or 'Eix' 
 for short.     
<h3>Normalisation</h3>
   A normalised lambda expression is one in which the arguments of applications
 are always variables, [Sestoft, 1996]. This includes the arguments of constructor
 functions as well as the second argument in the par expression. Converting
 an expression to normalised form is a simple matter of introducing extra
let bindings for offending arguments. Normalisation ensures that evaulations
of these arguments are always shared. The normalising conversions are as
follows,   
<blockquote>e<sub>1</sub> e<sub>2</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>-&gt;</b> &nbsp;<b>let 
 {</b> x = e<sub>2</sub> <b>} in </b>e<sub>1</sub> x<br>
  C e<sub>1</sub> ... e<sub>n</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>-&gt;&nbsp; let {</b> x<sub>1</sub> = e<sub>1</sub>, ...
 x<sub>n</sub> = e<sub>n</sub> <b>} in</b> C x<sub>1</sub> ... x<sub>n</sub><br>
  e<sub>1</sub> <b>par</b> e<sub>2</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>-&gt; &nbsp;let {</b> x = e<sub>2</sub> <b>} in</b>
 e<sub>1</sub> <b>par</b> x<br>
    <br>
  where {x} are fresh for each conversion<br>
  </blockquote>
  Although the application of these conversions does indeed result in expressions
 of normalised form, in practice the process of&nbsp; normalisation and the
 introduction of de Bruijn indicies takes place at the same time. The introduction
 of de Bruijn indicies removes the need for named variables. Spending time
 devising some system of generating fresh variables only to have them vanish
 in favour of de Bruijn indicies would be counter-productive.<br>
  <br>
        
<h3>Introduction of de Bruijn indicies</h3>
   de Bruijn indicies are introduced as follows.<br>
   <br>
  The parse tree is decended recursivly. This is done while maintaining a 
stack of variable names that co-respond to the heap pointers that would be 
present in the environment during the actual program reduction. When a variable 
name is encountered in an expression, the stack is searched for this name 
and the variable is replaced by the offset into the stack for that occurance.<br>
  <br>
  The following code gives a simplified version of the convertExp function
 used in the Ample2 implementation. Differences between the simplified version
 and the real one are discussed in the next section.<br>
  <br>
  convertExp takes a copy of the current program - a heap of Mark-3 expressions,
 a list respresenting the current environment and the source expression to
 convert. It converts the source expression to Mark-3 form and adds it to
the program. convertExp&nbsp; returns the new program and a pointer to the
top level cell for the converted expression.<br>
   
<pre>convertExp :: Heap M.Exp -&gt; [String] -&gt; S.Exp -&gt; (Heap M.Exp, Int)</pre>
  The function convertExps is defined in terms of convertExp.&nbsp; convertExps
 takes the current program, the current environment and a list of expressions.
 It converts the expressions one at a time, using the same environment, and
 adds them to the program. convertExps returns the new program and a list
of heap pointers, one for each converted expression.  
<pre>convertExps :: Heap M.Exp -&gt; [String] -&gt; [S.Exp] -&gt; (Heap M.Exp, [Int])</pre>
  <br>
  From reduction rule <a
 href="file:///home/neural/work/project/ample/ample2/work/doc/Rules_for_single_threaded_evaluation.html#st-app2">st-app<sub>2</sub></a>
 we see that during the reduction of a Lambda abstraction, the bound variable
 gets pushed onto the top of the environment and then control passes to the
 abstraction body. This is reflected in convertExp as the bound variable
also  gets pushed onto the top of the stack before recursivly calling convertExp
 on the body.&nbsp;   
<pre>convertExp prog env (S.Lambda var exp)   = (prog2, eix2)<br> where<br>        (prog1, eix1)	     = convertExp prog (var :env) exp<br>        (prog2, eix2)        = heapAdd prog1 (M.Lambda eix1)<br></pre>
  <br>
  The convertExp rule for applications shows normalisation taking place during
 the conversion to Mark-3 code. The complete conversion is as follows,   
<blockquote>e<sub>1</sub> e<sub>2</sub> <b>-&gt; let {</b> e<sub>2</sub>
  <b>} in</b> e<sub>1</sub><br>
  </blockquote>
  During this conversion a let binding is introduced which is not present 
in the original expression. This binding is un-named, yet still takes up space
in the environment. The convertExp function accounts for this by pushing
 the null string onto the stack as a place holder. This ensures that variable-name-to-de-Bruijn-index
 translations in sucessive conversions will work out.<br>
  <br>
   
<pre>convertExp prog env (S.ExpExp exp1 exp2) = (prog4, eix4)<br> where<br>        (prog1, eix1)        = convertExp prog  ("" :env) exp1<br>        (prog2, eix2)        = convertExp prog1 ("" :env) exp2<br>        (prog3, eix3)        = heapAdd prog2 (M.ExpVar exp1  0)<br>        (prog4, eix4)        = heapAdd prog3 (M.Let   [eix2] eix3)<br></pre>
  During the conversion of a Let expression it is important to note that
the  names of all bindings are pushed onto the stack at once, before any
of the expressions are converted. This allows the bindings to be mutually
dependent. In contrast, a machine which used static pointers to reference
the bindings instead of de Bruijn indicies would be forced to either pre-allocate
cells before the bindings are added to the program, or back patch the pointers 
afterwards.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
   
<pre>convertExp prog env (S.Let binds exp)    = (prog3, eix3)<br> where<br>        (bindVars, bindExps) = unzip binds<br>        env1                 = (reverse bindVars) ++ env<br>        (prog1, eixLs)       = convertExps prog  env1 bindExps<br>        (prog2, eix2)        = convertExp  prog1 env1 exp<br>        (prog3, eix3)        = heapAdd prog2 (M.Let eixLs eix2)<br></pre>
  sdfgsgf<br>
  <br>
   
<pre>convertExp prog env (S.Var var)          = (prog1, eix1)<br> where<br>        (prog1, eix1)        = heapAdd prog (M.Var (indexOf var env))<br></pre>

<h3>Convert Exp</h3>
   mamoth function. does lots of things all at once. thought about breaking 
 it up, but not straightforward.<br>
   <br>
   Want to do mark-3 conversion and normalization together because that way 
 you don't need a source of fresh variable names. The binding created is only
 referenced at one place. Binding is relative to the top of the stack, push
 "" into the bindings list as a 'place holder'. &nbsp; a, b, "",<br>

   <br>
   <br>
   have to lookup var names as we go,<br>
   also fill in source line numbers<br>
