<h1>Program / data representation.<br>
 </h1>
 <br>
 Ample2 defines a polymorphic heap type. Seperate instances of this type
are  used for both the data heap and for storage of program cells.<br>
 <br>
 
<h2>The Heap type</h2>
 A Heap cell can either be <tt>Active</tt>, <tt>Free</tt>. In the Active
state it contains a valid data. When a cell is Free it holds the index of
the next Free cell. This way, all the free cells in the heap form a linked
list. If index is set to -1 this indicates that the cell is the last one
in the list. 
<pre>data HeapCell a<br>        = Active  a<br>        | Free    Int<br></pre>
 <br>
 The Heap itself consists of an array of cells, a count of the number cells 
in the heap vs the number of free cells, and the index of the cell which is
the head of the free list. If there are no free cells then this index is
set to -1.<br>
 <br>
 
<pre>data Heap a =<br>        Heap {<br>                hCell        :: Array Int (HeapCell a),<br>                hCells       :: Int,<br>                hFreeCells   :: Int,<br>                hFreeHead    :: Int<br>        }<br></pre>
<h2>The Program Heap</h2>
 The program heap is used to store the program graph. A cell in the program 
heap consists of an expression; the line number in the source file where this
expression originated and the expression depth, which is used during construction
of the environment trimmers at compile time.<br>
 
<pre>data ProgCell<br>        = ProgCell {<br>                pcExp        :: Exp,<br>                pcSourceLine :: Int,<br>                pcDepth      :: Int<br>        }<br><br>type ProgHeap   = Heap ProgCell<br></pre>
<br>
<h2>The Data Heap<br>
</h2>
The data heap is used to store suspensions during the reduction of an Ample
program. A cell in the data heap consists of a mark - used for garbage collection;
an index into the program heap for the suspended expression; a copy of what
the environment was when the expression was suspended and the blocking queue,
a list of the threads which are waiting for this expression to be evaulated. 
<pre>data DataCell<br>        = DataCell {<br>                dcMark        :: Bool,<br>                dcEix         :: Int,<br>                dcEnv         :: [Int]<br>                dcBlocks      :: [Int]<br>        }<br><br>type DataHeap	= Heap DataCell<br></pre>
<br>
<h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
Ample uses a simple mark/sweep garbage collector. <br>
<br>
The first step in the garbage collection is to gather the list of first level
heap dependencies, that is, the list of all data cells directly referenced
by the machine state. This consists the cells referenced in the environment
and stack of all threads. This is a simple matter, though care must be taken
to ignore any base values that may be present in the environment, as discussed
in the section on base value handling.<br>
<br>
The function which determines the list of dependencies is stateDeps. stateDeps
calls slurpStackDeps and slurpEnvDeps to process the stack and the environment
respectivly.<br>
<br>
<pre>stateDeps      :: State -&gt; [Int]<br>slurpStackDeps :: Stack -&gt; [Int]<br>slurpEnvDeps   :: Env   -&gt; [Int]<br><br></pre>
All the first level heap dependencies are then marked, as well as all the
cells referenced in their environments, recursivly. The heap is then swept
from top to bottom, and all cells that are not marked are added to the free
list. The sweeping function also resets the mark on each cell as it procededs
through the heap.<br>
