\begin{abstract}
We design the design and construction of a High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) microwave filter to block the interference being suffered by the Narrabri Compact Array radio observatory between 2300 and 2400 MHz. After a successful copper prototype, the HTS filter was fabricated and tested. The filter response had the correct shape though the center frequency was 35MHz too high due to simulation and fabrication tolerances. Future work will be to produce a filter which has a center frequency around 50MHz lower than the current design, and trim the resonators down until it is at the correct frequency.
