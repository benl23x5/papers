\bigskip
The judgement form $\ksJudgeGS{\kappa}{\omega}$ reads: with environment $\Gamma$ and store typing $\Sigma$, kind $\kappa$ has super-kind $\omega$. 

KsAbs is the rule for the dependent kind abstraction. Note that a kind signature such as $\% \to *$ is also desugared to this form, resulting in $\Pi(\_ : \%). \ *$.  Although $\omega_1$ is only mentioned once in this rule, inclusion of the $\ksJudgeGS{\kappa_1}{\omega_1}$ premise ensures that the kind $\kappa_1$ is well formed.

KsApp is the application rule for super-kinds. As we (thankfully) do not need higher-order super kinds, the expression on the left of the super-kind arrow can always be a (non-super) kind.

KsAtom says that the super-kind of atomic kinds is always $\Box$.

The last three rules give super-kinds for the witness kind constructors. These allow us to check for malformed kind expressions such as  $\iPure \ (\iBool \ a)$ and $\iConst \ \iRead$.
