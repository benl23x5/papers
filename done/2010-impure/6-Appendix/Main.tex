\chapter{Proofs of Language Properties}
\label{proofs}

In this appendix we present the formal proofs of language properties for the system in \S\ref{Core:Simplified}, culminating in a proof of soundness. Each of these proofs is by induction over the derivation of a typing judgement. When presenting each case, we will assume the statement being considered and then invoke the standard inversion lemmas \cite{pierce:tapl} to fill in the appropriate premises.

For example, the proof of Substitution of Values in Values starts with the case $t = x$. We assume the statement 
\ $\tyJudge{\Gamma, \ x : \tau_2}{\Sigma}{x}{\tau_1}{\bot}$, and use the inversion lemma to give \ 
$x : \tau_1 \in \Gamma, \ x : \tau_2$.

$$
	\frac
	{ (2) \ x : \tau_1 \in \Gamma, \ x : \tau_2 }
	{ (\un{1}) \ 
	  \tyJudge
		{\Gamma, \ x : \tau_2}{\Sigma}
		{x}
		{\tau_1}
		{\bot}
	}
$$	

Each statement is numbered for identification purposes, and we underline the numbers of statements which are assumptions. In some
cases, not all statements obtained by the inversion lemmas will be used, but will include them as premises so that the typing rules maintain their familiar shapes.

We will omit the quantifiers ``for all'' and ``for some'' when they are obvious from the context, as they clutter the proof without providing much additional information.

Firstly, some standard lemmas:
