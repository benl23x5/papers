Don't Substitute Into Abstractions.
Tested with GHC 7.10.

 $ cabal update
 $ cabal build
 $ dist/build/lambda-dsim/lambda-dsim

You need to run the executable from the same directory as the
Prelude.macros file so that it can find it. The Prelude.macros
contains some macros for Church encoded things.

Examples from the paper:

 > (\x. \y. add x y z) (not y) five

 > (\x. \y. add x ((\z. z) y)) (not y) five

 > (\y. \x. \x. add one x y) x two three


Examples using Church encoded macros:

 This one produces a lambda term due to the Church encoding.

 > #fac #three

 If we want to get the result out then supply our own atoms
 the successor and zero, which also forces evaluation.

 > (#fac #three) s z

 Here is one that goes via a representation of cons-lists.

 > (#sum (#rangeDown #four)) s z
