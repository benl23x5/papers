\section{Chunked Streams}
\label{s:Chunked}
The flows we have discussed so far have processed elements of a generic type @e@. Although we can instantiate our operators at atomic types such as @Char@ and @Float@, in practice to gain reasonable runtime performance we must amortize the cost of control flow by processing a chunk containing several elements at a time. We instantiate the generic @Sources@ and @Sinks@ types to produce chunked versions @CSources@ and @CSinks@:
\begin{code}
   type CSources i m e = Sources i m (Vector e)
   type CSinks   i m e = Sinks   i m (Vector e)
\end{code}

In our Haskell implementation we use the unboxed @Vector@ type from the standard @vector@ library to represent chunks. For operators that do not inspect the actual elements, such as @drainP@ and @funnel_i@, their chunked versions are simply aliases for the generic versions, but with more specific types so that the API documentation is easier to read. Other operators such as the @folds@ family need separate implementations because their argument functions (of type (@a -> b -> a@)) work on single elements rather than chunks. 


% ---------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Intra-chunk Fusion}
\label{s:IntraChunk}
Fusion of operators on chunked streams arises naturally from the array fusion system already implemented in the @vector@ library, which processes the chunks. This happy situation is due to the fact that our generic flow operators are written in continuation passing style. For example, here is the definition of the map function for sources of chunked flows. We use the existing @map_i@ operator on generic flows, and the @umap@ operator on unboxed vectors. We suppress type class constraints to save space.
\begin{code}
   cmap_i :: (a -> b) 
          -> CSource i m e -> CSource i m e
   cmap_i f ss = map_i (umap f) ss
\end{code}

Now, suppose we map a per-element function @g@ over a flow, then map another per-element function @f@ to this result. Both @f@ and @g@ apply to all elements of all streams in each flow.
\begin{code}
   cmap_i f (cmap_i g ss)
\end{code}

We expand the @Sources@ value @ss@, naming the arity component @n@ and the pull function @pulls@.
\begin{code}
   cmap_i f (cmap_i g (Sources n pulls))
\end{code}

Inlining the definition of @cmap_i@ above gives:
\begin{code}
=> map_i (umap f) (map_i (umap g) (Sources n pulls))
\end{code}

Inlining the definition of @map_i@ and simplifying then yields:
\begin{alltt}
=> Sources n (\(\lambda\)i eat eject.
     pulls i (\(\lambda\)v. eat (umap f (umap g v))) eject)
\end{alltt}
The two instances of @umap@ are now syntactically adjacent, which allows the fusion system in the vector library to fire:

\begin{alltt}
=> Sources n (\(\lambda\)i eat eject.
     pulls i (\(\lambda\)v. eat (umap (f \(\circ\) g) v)) eject)
\end{alltt}

Suppose we pull some data from this flow source. We apply the contained function to the index @i@ of the stream we are interested in, and provide our own @eat@ and @eject@ functions to either to consume a chunk or indicate that there is no more data available in stream @i@. The flow source would then apply the @pulls@ function from \emph{its} own parent source to the inner continuation. If a chunk from the parent source is available, then the @umap@ function will then apply the fused @f@ and @g@ to each element, before passing the result to the original @eat@ function that we provided.


% ---------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Leftovers}
When flows carry chunks instead of single elements it becomes naturally harder to write operators that consume only a few elements at a time, rather than a whole chunk at a time. Consider the @head_i@ operator which splits the first element from a specified argument stream, as well as producing a flow of the leftover elements:
\begin{code}
 head_i :: i -> Sources i m a -> (a, Sources i m a)
\end{code}

Libraries like @conduit@~\cite{hackage:conduit} manage leftovers by extending the representation of stream sources with a special constructor that carries an array of leftover elements from a previous chunk, as well as the continuation to pull more chunks from the source. For Repa Flow we avoid adding more constructors to our @Source@ and @Sink@ data types, as moving away from the simple continuation passing style of @pull@, @eat@ and @eject@ makes it harder to perform the program simplifications that enable intra-chunk fusion. Instead, operators such as @head@ produce a new flow source where the embedded @pull@ function first produces a chunk containing leftover elements before pulling more chunks from its own source. The chunk of leftover elements is stored in the closure of the pull function itself, rather than being reified into the representation of the @Source@ data type. We rely on the linearity convention to ensure the argument source is not reused, as applying @head_i@ to the same source would yield the first element in the \emph{next} chunk, rather than the next element after the one that was previously returned.
