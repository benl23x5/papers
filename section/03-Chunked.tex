\section{Chunked streams and Fusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chunked streams to reduce overhead.
\item Show how chunked streams can be implemented with generic streams.
\item Using the linearity contraint, leftovers for a combinator like @head@ are handled by returning a new stream that has buffered the leftovers.
\item Linearity contraint means we can safely INLINE all the code while avoiding code explosion.


\end{itemize}
